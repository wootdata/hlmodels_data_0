Camo Grunt skin by Teppic8
teppic8@yahoo.com

Re-coloured Recon Grunt so that you can change the camo colour.

Skin info:

chrome: no (soon!)
Hue shift: yes
animation: unmodified Valve anims

I extracted the skin using Mdlviewer v2.1.0402, and re-coloured it in PSP.

To use, extract the .zip file (camo.bmp and camo.mdl) into valve/models/player/camo/
